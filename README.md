# Project - OO Systems Development

## Subject

The subject is free but rules are imposed:
- code at least two services communicating (one using the REST architecture, the
other the RPC architecture).
- Each service must have its own database (more than one type of database is
desirable : SQL, NoSQLâ€¦).
- Respect the rules given in the following project (to be adapted according to the
programming language): https://github.com/charroux/JavaCodingRules
- The services must be documented according to the Open API specification
(Swagger). Show screen shots in the Readme page oy your repository.
- Explain your project in the Readme page.
- The Rest service must be accessible via curl (give the list of the requests in the
Readme of your repository), or via a Javascript program (noted as a bonus) (give
screen shots in the Readme page) (separate the services from the Javascript)
